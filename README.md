# Random Quote Generator Plugin for WordPress

The Random Quote Generator Plugin allows you to display a random quote on your WordPress website. This can be useful for adding inspirational quotes, interesting facts, or any other type of content that you want to rotate randomly and keep your users engaged.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from this GitHub repository page.

2. Login to your WordPress admin dashboard.

3. Navigate to `Plugins` > `Add New`.

4. Click on the `Upload Plugin` button.

5. Choose the downloaded ZIP file and click `Install Now`.

6. Once installed, click on `Activate` to activate the plugin.

## Usage

### Add Quotes

1. After activating the plugin, a new menu item called `Quotes` will appear in your WordPress admin dashboard.

2. Click on `Quotes` to add new quotes. You can add as many quotes as you like.

3. Each quote is treated as a separate post with the custom post type `Quote`. You can add the quote content in the main editor.

### Display a Random Quote

To display a random quote on your posts or pages, you can use the `[random_quote]` shortcode.

1. In the WordPress editor, create or edit a post or page where you want to display the random quote.

2. Add the `[random_quote]` shortcode at the desired location within the content.

3. Save or update the post/page.

The plugin will automatically replace the `[random_quote]` shortcode with a randomly selected quote from the list of quotes you added.

### Customization

The Random Quote Generator Plugin is designed to be lightweight and simple. At the moment, there are no additional customization options available in the plugin settings.

However, you can easily customize the appearance of the displayed quotes by modifying the CSS styles in your theme's custom CSS or using a custom CSS plugin.
